NORMAL CONDITIONS

For the Jupyter notebook "midterm.ipynb" to work as delivered
an open internet connection is required. 

The notebook access's the website "https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php" 
and scrapes links to premier league CSV files which is the data that it analyses.
It stores the files temporarily in the memory and does not create a flat file.

you must also include the "dataAnalysis.py" file in the same directory as "midterm.ipynb".
"dataAnalysis.py" file includes functions written for the purpose of analysing the data
set and simplifying code blocks.


IF NO INTERNET CONNECTION.

If access to the web is not possible the specific CSV documents used, were included as a
sample data set.

To access the files, include them in the same directory as the "midterm.ipynb" file
and change the CSV read commands from:

"s2019 = pd.read_csv(data[1], sep=",", index_col=0) 
 s2018 = pd.read_csv(data[2], sep=",", index_col=0)
 s2017 = pd.read_csv(data[3], sep=",", index_col=0)
 s2016 = pd.read_csv(data[4], sep=",", index_col=0)
 s2015 = pd.read_csv(data[5], sep=",", index_col=0)"

To:

"s2019 = pd.read_csv("2019_2020se.csv", sep=",", index_col=0)
 s2018 = pd.read_csv("2018_2019se.csv", sep=",", index_col=0)
 s2017 = pd.read_csv("2017_2018se.csv", sep=",", index_col=0)
 s2016 = pd.read_csv("2016_2017se.csv", sep=",", index_col=0)
 s2015 = pd.read_csv("2015_2016se.csv", sep=",", index_col=0)"
